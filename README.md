# Getting started with Ethereum
The definitive guide to onboaring Ethereum!

## Introduction

This guide will set you up with the minimum requirements to be a fullt-fledged Ethereum user. For learning about Ethereum itself please refer to this source: `ethereum.org`

## Your setup

- This guide wil asume your are using a device (laptop or desktop) with a `Windows` Operating System (Ideally Windows 10 or higher)

- The first and only requirement is to install the browser `Google Chrome`. It is not 100% required, but it is highly recommended.

## Getting a Wallet

For our purposes, a `wallet` is a piece of software that allows users to interact with a Blockchain (in our case, the Ethereum Blockchain). This is were the native tokens of said blockchain, `$eth`, will get stored.

`Metamask` is a browser extension wallet and it is the most widely used accross the ecosystem. It is the one we are going to use. With Metamask installed we will be able to use to communicate and interact with the Ethereum Blockchain.

### Installing Metamask

To install Metamask we are going to go to [metamask.io](https://metamask.io/) Now, crypto is full of scammers and ill-faith actors, so you need to make sure that when downloading Metamask you're doing it from the official website. A little trick I use is to go to [Metamask's twitter account](https://twitter.com/MetaMask) (which has a verified icon) and follow the link in their profile. Make sure to bookmark it the first time you visit the site, that way you won't worry the next times you access it.

Once there you are going to click in `Download for Chrome` or `Download` and you will be directed to another site in which you will click `Add to Chrome`. And that's it! The Metamask extension is now installed on your brwoser.

### Metamask setup

Metamask will start and ask you to import a wallet ot to create a new one. We are going to create a new one.

The next few steps are most important. You will be given a 12-word seed-phrase and you will choose a password for your Metamask wallet. It is critical that both the 12-word seed-phrase and the password are keep secret, private and hidden. Make sure to write the 12-word seed-phrase down and hide it somewhere safe. 

The reason is simple, these keys are what give you access to your wallet, they control it. As long as your are the only one who knows the keys, everything will be fine. If you lose them and forget them or someone else gets access to them, your funds and your wallet will be lost forever.

And finally, the password you create simply allows you to access your wallet without using the seed-phrase. Should you lose your password, reset it with your seed-phrase.

## Networks

Congratulations! You now have an Ethereum wallet with its keys in a safe place. You are almost ready to use Ethereum. Before we proceed, allow me to explain you something. The Ethereum network is very expensive to use due to the high demand from everyone to use it and the way it is built. There are incoming updates to the software of Ethereum to make it more scalable and what's best, the are solutions to this problem that exist today. 
These are the so-called `Layer-2 networks`. You don't need to know how these work in order to use them but feel free to do your own research if you like (recommended). We are going to take advantage of this new technology to avoid paying huge sums in transaction fees. The two most popular L2s are `optimism` and `arbitrum`.

### Adding Optimism and Arbitrum to Metamask

Metamask can't connect with these L2s by default, we need to add the network configurations manually. Don't feel intimidated, it is extremely simple.

We will do Optimism first. Go to [Optimism's webpage](https://www.optimism.io/)
